Personal Notes:
This project might have been one of the toughest that I have done. Not because it was very technical but it was emotionally draining.
I had high hopes for my team at the beginning as we formed early, but that quickly became the opposite when our personal deadlines that 
we set for the reports and the game development were not met repeatly. Egi (Producer) and I would grow increasingly frustrated and demoralised
as we would come to lab and felt that progress was lacking despite the two of us being on track.

Overtime, I started to doubt if Liu Ke and Yong Hui was slacking off or if they were having issues with the coding. Thats when I spoke 
to them and come to learn that they were struggling with programming and the work load of the course.

Despite struggling with the code, often I would come to lab and see them idling, instead of taking the intiative to ask the TA or lecturals for help
and it would further affect both how me and Egi felt.

As the technical director, I wanted to give them the space to write the code and figure it out. But I had to step when we really exceeded the dateline. 
I had to take the time to help them figure out the pseduo code/steps and wrote some of the code for the systems. In combination with helping with the overall debugging,
as selfish as it may sound, I wonder if the time could be better spent so that I could contribute more lines of code.

In the end, it is diffcult to think of a solution to this issue which makes it really frustrating.
Were me and the producer too passive with the deadlines? Would it have been better if we more assertive ? Although it might not work as it comes down to the second issue:
Whats the solution to a teammate struggling with programing or work load and is this valid?
