The goal of the game is to get to the end of the level. You will need to overcome obstacles by using 
your hook to swing across them or to attack enemies

To swing using the hook you need to first jump, followed by holding down the left click.
When you are facing the correct direction/angle you then release to let your character fly towards
the intended direction.

Make sure to avoid spikes and destory enemies before they hit you.

Tip: Knowing how far to fire is important as it affects your speed and the area where u can swing. 
     In tight corner it is better to fire closer.
