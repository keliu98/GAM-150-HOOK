COURSE: CSD1450s21, AM Tesla class

Hook is a pixel art game that revolves around the player, Mr. Hook. However, he was separated from his partner, Rex before their adventure can begin. So, the goal of the game is to get the sacred artifact lying deep in the cave while finding for the exit. However, in order to get through the different game levels, Mr. Hook will need to use the ‘Hookshot’ mechanic. This special feature allows him to either hook onto empty spaces or enemies to kill them.

The level is designed from left to right. So the goal is to reach the end of the cave by exploring around the level. You will need to overcome obstacles by using your hook to swing across them or to attack enemies

To swing using the hook you need to first jump, followed by holding down the left click.
When you are facing the correct direction/angle you then release to let your character fly towards
the intended direction.

Make sure to avoid spikes and destory enemies before they hit you.

Tip: Knowing how far to fire is important as it affects your speed and the area where u can swing. In tight corner it is better to fire closer.

The only cheat codes we have for now is to alter the text file in the 'Levels' folder. This way, we can change the character or exit position in the levels. We can also create massive amount of enemies by altering the text file.
